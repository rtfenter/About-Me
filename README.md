This GitHub is structured as a map of my work — beginning with lightweight AI interaction prototypes and expanding outward into systems design, event governance, platform tooling, and architectural frameworks.


# Portfolio Overview

If you’re exploring my work for the first time, the AI & ML UX Systems Series is the most accessible entry point — they’re lightweight interaction prototypes that show my model intuition, product thinking, and AI reasoning.

# 7. Recursive Identity Architecture (RIA)  
Recursive Identity Architecture (RIA) is **my original, independently developed framework** for understanding how complex systems—human or machine—preserve coherence, meaning, and identity under contradiction and uncertainty.

RIA explores:  
- meaning and authorship schemas  
- recursion and paradox stability  
- signal compression and expansion  
- identity integrity under uncertainty
