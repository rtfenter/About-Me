# Hi, I’m Rebecca  
### Product Manager specializing in scaling B2B SaaS and platform systems

I specialize in scaling **B2B SaaS and platform systems** with proven adoption across global, multi-system environments. I lead the product side of core infrastructure — governing data integrations, system logic, and **AI-ready architecture** across engineering and business teams.

I’ve led multi-system platforms built for governance, analytics, and long-term extensibility, aligning engineering delivery with business outcomes and real user needs. My experience spans **API-driven systems, event-informed workflows, and cross-system state transitions**, with familiarity across MuleSoft, Snowflake, Salesforce, and Kafka.

**AI-aligned product design**, in my work, means building systems structured for automation, intelligent analytics, and responsible scale.

Beyond enterprise delivery, my independent work examines how complex systems preserve **truth, coherence, and decision integrity** under uncertainty — and how AI can be built to do the same.

# Portfolio Series 

## **1. Systems of Trust Series**  
Tools and models for **event governance, schema integrity, and truth preservation**.

**Why it exists:** Distributed systems fail quietly when meaning drifts.  
**Why it matters:** AI, automation, and multi-service scaling require consistent truth.

## **2. Loyalty Systems Series**  
Applied loyalty architecture for **FX, tiering, reconciliation, and value drift**.

**Why it exists:** Loyalty behaves like a distributed system, not a marketing feature.  
**Why it matters:** Value, ratios, and meaning diverge across regions without governance.

## **3. Applied Intelligence Systems Series**  
Tools exploring how **AI, agents, and intelligent systems interpret signals and drift over time**.

**Why it exists:** Intelligent systems misalign for the same reasons distributed systems do — meaning, context, and ownership drift.  
**Why it matters:** AI requires governance of interpretation, constraints, and authorship.

# Recursive Identity Architecture (RIA)

RIA is my independent architecture for **holding contradiction, preserving coherence, and preventing drift** in complex systems — human or machine.  
It underpins how I think about truth, governance, and alignment across all three series.
