# Hi, I’m Rebecca  
### Product Manager specializing in scaling B2B SaaS and platform systems

I specialize in scaling **B2B SaaS and platform systems** with proven adoption across global, multi-system environments. I lead the product side of core infrastructure — governing data integrations, system logic, and **AI-ready architecture** across engineering and business teams.

I’ve led multi-system platforms built for governance, analytics, and long-term extensibility, aligning engineering delivery with business outcomes and real user needs. My experience spans **API-driven systems, event-informed workflows, and cross-system state transitions**, with familiarity across MuleSoft, Snowflake, Salesforce, and Kafka.

**AI-aligned product design**, in my work, means building systems structured for automation, intelligent analytics, and responsible scale.

Beyond enterprise delivery, my independent work examines how complex systems preserve **truth, coherence, and decision integrity** under uncertainty — and how AI can be built to do the same.

# 🧭 Where to Start  
Recruiters and hiring managers usually begin with:

1. **Systems of Trust Series** — clean, high-signal PM/system design thinking  
2. **Loyalty Systems Series** — your deepest real-world domain expertise  
3. **Applied Intelligence Systems Series** — your AI/agent reasoning skillset  
4. **AI & ML UX Systems Series** — recruiter-friendly, intuitive AI demos  

Everything is designed to be **legible in under 3 minutes**, with deeper layers available.

# 1. Systems of Trust Series  
Tools and models for **event governance, schema integrity, and truth preservation** in distributed systems.

**Main Hub:**  
https://github.com/rtfenter/Systems-of-Trust-Series

**Prototypes**  
- Event Quality Scanner  
  https://github.com/rtfenter/Event-Quality-Scanner  
- Event Consistency Checker  
  https://github.com/rtfenter/Event-Consistency-Checker  
- Truth Drift Map  
  https://github.com/rtfenter/Truth-Drift-Map  
- Cross-Service Meaning Comparator  
  https://github.com/rtfenter/Cross-Service-Meaning-Comparator  
- Schema Evolution Impact Analyzer  
  https://github.com/rtfenter/Schema-Evolution-Impact-Analyzer

  https://github.com/rtfenter/Ownership-Boundary-Validator  

**Why it exists**  
Distributed systems fail quietly when meaning drifts.

**Why it matters**  
AI, automation, and multi-service scaling require consistent truth.

# 2. Loyalty Systems Series  
Applied loyalty architecture for **FX, tiering, reconciliation, and value drift** — your strongest real-world specialization.

**Main Hub:**  
https://github.com/rtfenter/Loyalty-Systems-Series

**Prototypes**  
- Loyalty Points Simulator  
  https://github.com/rtfenter/Loyalty-Points-Simulator

- Redemption Value Integrity Checker *(coming)*  
- FX Drift Analyzer for Loyalty Value *(coming)*  
- Loyalty Ledger Reconciliation Sandbox *(coming)*  

**Why it exists**  
Loyalty behaves like a distributed system, not a marketing feature.

**Why it matters**  
Value and meaning drift without strong contracts and reconciliation.

---

# 3. Applied Intelligence Systems Series  
Tools exploring how **AI systems, agents, and models interpret signals, drift, and make decisions**.

**Main Hub:**  
https://github.com/rtfenter/Applied-Intelligence-Systems-Series

- Model Decision Graph Viewer *(coming)*  
- Agent State Transition Map *(coming)*  
- AI Failure Mode Explorer *(coming)*  

**Why it exists**  
AI systems misalign for the same reasons distributed systems do — context, meaning, and ownership drift.

**Why it matters**  
Reliable AI requires architecture that protects interpretation, constraints, and authorship.

---

# 4. Platform Systems & Internal Tooling Series  
Internal tools for **integrations, rule engines, debugging workflows, and data pipelines**.

**Main Hub:**

- Invariants Visualizer *(coming)*  
- Contract Evolution Timeline *(coming)*  
- Incident Meaning Graph *(coming)*  
- Data Ownership Mapper *(coming)*  

**Why it exists**  
Demonstrates enterprise platform PM competencies: governance, DevEx tooling, resilience, and internal workflows.

---

# 5. AI & ML UX Systems Series  
Recruiter-friendly **UX-first AI prototypes** that demonstrate model behavior, retrieval reasoning, and embeddings.

**Main Hub:**  
https://github.com/rtfenter/AI-ML-UX-Systems-Series *(to be created)*
