# Hi, I’m Rebecca  
### Product Manager specializing in scaling B2B SaaS and platform systems

I specialize in scaling **B2B SaaS and platform systems** across global, multi-service environments. I lead the product side of core infrastructure — governing data integrations, system logic, and **AI-ready architecture** across engineering and business teams.

My work focuses on **API-driven systems, event-informed workflows, and cross-system state transitions**, with familiarity across MuleSoft, Snowflake, Salesforce, and Kafka.

**AI-aligned product design**, in this context, means building systems structured for automation, intelligent analytics, and responsible scale.

Beyond enterprise delivery, my independent work examines how complex systems preserve **truth, coherence, and decision integrity** under uncertainty — and how AI can be shaped to do the same.
