# Hi, I’m Rebecca  
### Product Manager specializing in scaling B2B SaaS and platform systems

I specialize in scaling **B2B SaaS and platform systems** with proven adoption across global, multi-system environments. I lead the product side of core infrastructure — governing data integrations, system logic, and **AI-ready architecture** across engineering and business teams.

I’ve led multi-system platforms built for governance, analytics, and long-term extensibility, aligning engineering delivery with business outcomes and real user needs. My experience spans **API-driven systems, event-informed workflows, and cross-system state transitions**, with familiarity across MuleSoft, Snowflake, Salesforce, and Kafka.

**AI-aligned product design**, in my work, means building systems structured for automation, intelligent analytics, and responsible scale.

Beyond enterprise delivery, my independent work examines how complex systems preserve **truth, coherence, and decision integrity** under uncertainty — and how AI can be built to do the same.

# Portfolio Series  
Each series begins with a **main hub repo** that organizes prototypes, diagrams, and essays.

---

# 1. Systems of Trust Series  
Tools and models for **event governance, schema integrity, and truth preservation** in distributed systems.

**Main Hub:**  
https://github.com/rtfenter/Systems-of-Trust-Series

**Prototypes**  
- Event Quality Scanner  
  https://github.com/rtfenter/Event-Quality-Scanner  
- Truth Drift Map  
  https://github.com/rtfenter/Truth-Drift-Map  
- Event Consistency Checker  
  https://github.com/rtfenter/Event-Consistency-Checker  
- Cross-Service Meaning Diff Tool  
- Schema Evolution Impact Analyzer  
- Event Routing Contract Checker  
- Ownership Boundary Validator  

**Why it exists**  
Distributed systems fail quietly when meaning drifts.

**Why it matters**  
AI, automation, and multi-service scaling require consistent truth.

---

# 2. Loyalty Systems Series  
Applied loyalty architecture for **FX, tiering, reconciliation, and value drift**.

**Main Hub:**  
https://github.com/rtfenter/Loyalty-Systems-Series

**Prototypes**  
- Loyalty Points Simulator  
  https://github.com/rtfenter/Loyalty-Points-Simulator  
- Loyalty Drift Dashboard  
  https://github.com/rtfenter/Loyalty-Drift-Dashboard  
- Loyalty Event Contract Validator  
  https://github.com/rtfenter/Loyalty-Event-Contract-Validator  
- Tier Progression Visualizer  
- Partner Rule Tester (Loyalty Edition)  
- Redemption Value Integrity Checker  
- FX Drift Analyzer for Loyalty Value  
- Loyalty Ledger Reconciliation Sandbox  

**Why it exists**  
Loyalty behaves like a distributed system, not a marketing feature.

**Why it matters**  
Value and meaning drift without strong contracts and reconciliation.

---

# 3. Applied Intelligence Systems Series  
Tools exploring how **AI systems, agents, and models interpret signals and drift over time**.

**Main Hub:**  
https://github.com/rtfenter/Applied-Intelligence-Systems-Series

**Prototypes**  
- Agent Behavior Sandbox  
  https://github.com/rtfenter/Agent-Behavior-Sandbox  
- ML Input Drift Playground  
- LLM Governance / Guardrail Visualizer  
- Model Decision Graph Viewer  
- Agent State Transition Map  
- AI Failure Mode Explorer  

**Why it exists**  
AI systems misalign for the same reasons distributed systems do — context, meaning, and ownership drift.

**Why it matters**  
Reliable AI needs architecture that protects interpretation, constraints, and authorship.

---

# 4. Platform Systems & Internal Tooling Series  
Internal tools for **integrations, rule engines, debugging workflows, and orchestration**.

**Main Hub:**  
https://github.com/rtfenter/Platform-Systems-Series *(to be created)*

**Prototypes**

- Integration Pipeline Visualizer (ETL / routing)  
- Debug / Replay Sandbox  
- Invariants Visualizer  
- Contract Evolution Timeline  
- Incident Meaning Graph  
- Data Ownership Mapper  

**Why it exists**  
This series demonstrates enterprise platform PM competencies: governance, DevEx tooling, resilience, and internal workflows.

---

# 5. AI Feature Playground  
Recruiter-friendly **UX-first AI demos** that showcase model behavior and intuitive AI interactions.

**Main Hub:**  
https://github.com/rtfenter/AI-Feature-Playground *(to be created)*

**Prototypes**  
- Conversational AI Chatbot (with personas)  
- Summarization Playground  
- Sentiment & Tone Classifier  
- Prompt–Response Variation Explorer  
- Embeddings Visual Map  
- Minimal RAG Search Demo  
- Model Explainer (“Explain My Answer”)  
- Classification Threshold Tuner  

**Why it exists**  
These are intuitive, industry-familiar AI features that hiring managers can understand immediately — ideal for interviews and portfolio reviews.

---

# 6. Recursive Identity Architecture (RIA)  
Conceptual architecture for **holding contradiction, preserving coherence, and preventing drift** in complex systems — human or machine.

**Main Hub:**  
https://github.com/rtfenter/RIA-Research-Notes

RIA explores conceptual structures such as:  
- meaning and authorship schemas  
- recursion and paradox stability  
- signal compression and expansion  
- identity integrity under uncertainty  

**Prototypes**  
- RIA Interactive Map  
- Signal Compression / Expansion Playground  
- Recursive Diagnostic Tool  
- Schema Alignment (Conceptual Meaning Schema)  
- Decision-Trace Exporter  
- Paradox Coherence Viewer
