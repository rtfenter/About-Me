# Hi, I’m Rebecca  
### Product Manager specializing in scaling B2B SaaS and platform systems

I specialize in scaling **B2B SaaS and platform systems** with proven adoption across global, multi-system environments. I lead the product side of core infrastructure — governing data integrations, system logic, and **AI-ready architecture** across engineering and business teams.

I’ve led multi-system platforms built for governance, analytics, and long-term extensibility, aligning engineering delivery with business outcomes and real user needs. My experience spans **API-driven systems, event-informed workflows, and cross-system state transitions**, with familiarity across MuleSoft, Snowflake, Salesforce, and Kafka.

**AI-aligned product design**, in my work, means building systems structured for automation, intelligent analytics, and responsible scale.

Beyond enterprise delivery, my independent work examines how complex systems preserve **truth, coherence, and decision integrity** under uncertainty — and how AI can be built to do the same.

# Portfolio Series  
Each series has its own **main hub repo** that organizes prototypes, diagrams, and essays.

---

## **1. Systems of Trust Series**  
**Main Hub:**  
[![Systems of Trust Series](https://img.shields.io/badge/Systems%20of%20Trust%20Series-000?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/rtfenter/Systems-of-Trust-Series)

Tools and models for **event governance, schema integrity, and truth preservation**.

**Navigate:**  
Start in the hub repo → explore the prototypes inside it → open linked live demos.

**Why it exists:** Distributed systems fail quietly when meaning drifts.  
**Why it matters:** AI, automation, and multi-service scaling require consistent truth.

**Prototypes:**  
[![Event Quality Scanner](https://img.shields.io/badge/Event%20Quality%20Scanner-000?style=flat)](https://github.com/rtfenter/Event-Quality-Scanner)  
[![Truth Drift Map](https://img.shields.io/badge/Truth%20Drift%20Map-000?style=flat)](https://github.com/rtfenter/Truth-Drift-Map)  
[![Event Consistency Checker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Event%20Consistency%20Checker-000?style=flat)](https://github.com/rtfenter/Event-Consistency-Checker)

## **2. Loyalty Systems Series**  
**Main Hub:**  
[![Loyalty Systems Series](https://img.shields.io/badge/Loyalty%20Systems%20Series-000?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/rtfenter/Loyalty-Systems-Series)

Applied loyalty architecture for **FX, tiering, reconciliation, and value drift**.

**Navigate:**  
Start in the hub repo → open prototype repos → use linked live demos.

**Why it exists:** Loyalty behaves like a distributed system, not a marketing feature.  
**Why it matters:** Value and meaning drift without strong contracts and reconciliation.

**Prototypes:**  
[![Loyalty Points Simulator](https://img.shields.io/badge/Loyalty%20Points%20Simulator-000?style=flat)](https://github.com/rtfenter/Loyalty-Points-Simulator)  
[![Loyalty Drift Dashboard](https://img.shields.io/badge/Loyalty%20Drift%20Dashboard-000?style=flat)](https://github.com/rtfenter/Loyalty-Drift-Dashboard)  
[![Loyalty Event Contract Validator](https://img.shields.io/badge/Loyalty%20Event%20Contract%20Validator-000?style=flat)](https://github.com/rtfenter/Loyalty-Event-Contract-Validator)

**Live Demo:**

## **3. Applied Intelligence Systems Series**  
**Main Hub:**  
[![Applied Intelligence Systems Series](https://img.shields.io/badge/Applied%20Intelligence%20Systems%20Series-000?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/rtfenter/Applied-Intelligence-Systems-Series)

Tools exploring how **AI, agents, and intelligent systems interpret signals and drift over time**.

**Navigate:**  
Open the hub → move through prototypes → check diagrams + planned expansions.

**Why it exists:** Intelligent systems misalign for the same reasons distributed systems do — meaning, context, and ownership drift.  
**Why it matters:** Responsible AI needs architecture that protects interpretation, constraints, and authorship.

**Prototypes:**  
[![Agent Behavior Sandbox](https://img.shields.io/badge/Agent%20Behavior%20Sandbox-000?style=flat)](https://github.com/rtfenter/Agent-Behavior-Sandbox)

# Recursive Identity Architecture (RIA)

**Main Hub:**  
[![RIA Research Notes](https://img.shields.io/badge/RIA%20Research%20Notes-000?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/rtfenter/RIA-Research-Notes)

**RIA** is my independent architecture for **holding contradiction, preserving coherence, and preventing drift** in complex systems — human or machine.  
It underpins how I think about truth, governance, architecture, and alignment across all three portfolio series.

The hub repo includes the conceptual models, loops, explainers, and system notes that inform the prototypes across this GitHub.
